Hello,  

I write again  
To tell you of the pain  
That you've made me writhe with and  
The thoughts that have crossed and almost crushed my mind  
How you've had me wonder and my thoughts wander  
If there will ever be a moment when we'll be together  
You've made me lose hope only to find it again  
In that place where it's not pain or anger that I feel but something in between  
I hoped I'll be brave enough to find out if all this was for nothing  
I hope I'll be able to look back at that moment  
and smile at the torment  
Find out that you knew it all  
That you could see me almost fall  
See me always watch from my dark corner trying to keep it all  
In one piece and that I want to give up that one piece that it has taken all but some peace to put together  
I've walked away from my tethers and left the shatters of the images that thrilled and bound me  
To keep my mind and eyes fixed since the moment I found you  
I believe I've come to redefine my pride  
As entangled as these words are I hope you don't just see the lines but read in between them to find my state of mind.
