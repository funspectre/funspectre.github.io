I believe virtually everyone in this current age owns a telephone. I can also assume that to an extent these devices are extensions of our personal lives and an important part of our inter-personal relations. As much as these devices have their merits, like any tool, they can be misused. So, I have come up with a set of rules that I live by, that stem from careful observations, that can help to minimize their demerits and make their use more hassle-free.

###1. Two Calls and a Text

Whenever I try to reach someone by their phone, If unsuccessful the first time, I redial only one more time then proceed to leave an SMS so as not to badger them.

###2. Always Connect

I try to stay available at all times. When I can not, I make sure all texts are replied and all missed calls returned. If I am held up and can not take a call then I hang up and follow up with a text. Also, I do not engage in the habit of "flashing" which I do find annoying. In the worst case scenario, I send a Call-me SMS which is a free service that most network providers make available.

###3. 2 weeks, 2 minutes

I try to shy away from using other people's telephones but there are times when I am without the means to fund my own calls and I have to resort to using a friend's phone. In this case, I make sure not to spend more than 2 minutes of his/her airtime and also not to use his/her phone more than once in two weeks.

###4. I.C.E

In the case of emergency, I would advise that you stick to this priority list in an effort to make contact

* Call
* SMS
* Call me SMS
* 2 minutes call from someone else's phone
* Text from someone else's phone
* Airtime borrowing service
