I walk in the room  
Take off that shirt, no tie  
Oh my, all that's on my mind's the ties we had  
I believe we still have  
I run my hand through my stubborn hair right down the middle where it'll split in two halves  
My focus has been distracted a while  
I thought I stopped thinking so much about you  
But I only started thinking about not thinking about you  
Though I stopped thinking so much, I kept caring  
Even though you pushed me far away, I crept  
crawling slowly, painfully  
Truthfully, trust me, I can wait for normalcy  
Even if it never comes to be  
I know there's no "supposed to be"  
Last I checked, this is way deliberate than I get  
Everyone says I'll soon forget  
And I'm optimistically hoping that when I do  
I'll be like the 95 year old with Alzheimer's with a woman by his bed  
That his every cell and bone tell him he should know,even when his head  
Says "no"  
He'll reason with the essence of his very being not the brain that fails him  
And that one way he'll go.
