I was cut  
I was wowed  
Her beauty was loud  
And her edge made me proud  
She slices through the air  
Making all the trouble look fair  
Her beauty is sheathed in truth  
And she's always by my side like I'm Naomi and she's Ruth  
I would never let her go  
Ironically, she's got a grip on me  
And sometimes in a moment of wrong perception  
She strips my sight and my mind of illusions and misconceptions  
Even when she cuts me and I bleed  
I set aside my burdensome ego to take her lead  
I'm astonished as her speed is filled with grace  
I'm content with the smug look on her face  
And right through her  
I see reflections from the past  
And refractions from the future  
With her by my side  
I can't seem to find my pride  
She's a friend and a companion  
She puts all my worries to oblivion  
She makes me feel excellent in every manner  
You could say she's my katana
