The last time I did this, I made a decision to stick like glue to you  
And provide a shoulder to lean on when yours ain't in the mood  
I decided to always be in the hood even when things aren't good  
I'll still stick to these like I'll stick with you  
I'm still your friend whether or not the skies stay blue  
I'll still hang around when there's no reason or clue  
Even when you rock a band of trouble, we'll do it double  
Cos I'm the only one that makes up the few that'll stick with you  
I live for all that is true and never give up on all that I do  
And be your friend, right now, is all I want to do  
If all I've said has a lot of "I" in it, trust me when I say that's where I put you  
We'll touch the fires that burn and get tickled  
Stare in the face of fear and watch tears trickle  
Out of our minds, bless our kind  
When the darkness puts we in a corner, we'll turn on the lights  
Because their nights can't take our light  
We care but still think you can bite us  
We don't come in parts so you can't tithe us  
Right now I feel given away  
And all I have ain't mine; His life, thoughts of you, the might  
Don't listen to the air when all it says is I don't care  
Cos I'm not all of that or this  
I'm stuck with you all the way through and out  

Yours oddly, a misfit.
