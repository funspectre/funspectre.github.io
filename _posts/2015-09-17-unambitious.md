My mind used to be filled with you  
It was packed to the brim, there was not a queue  
Now I feel strange, my mind's so empty now  
And I'm really wondering how  
We both should be now  
I still want you to make me feel wow  
I still want to smile while I watch  you smile  
Converse with and pour my heart out to you while  
I'm half stuck in quicksand and half drowning in that Nile  
All of this and I'm still wondering  
What are friends for?  
Let's find out together  
Sever the bonds, let's break all the tethers  
Know what it is to correspond via letters  
Read between every line, word, into every letter  
Count on every finger, toe till we run out of numbers  
Yet we still remember how the best days were  
Hey Amiga, I'm eager to once again hang together  
Let's be what you say we were, let's not be old friends  
Let this not be ashes, vestiges of the old fiend
