Hello,

I can feel your heart quiver and your bones ache  
I do know you might think loving was a mistake  
You also might think I have gone AWOL  
While I sit here and watch your countenance fall  
You probably ask in your heart - that oh so beautiful heart  
Why bad things happen to good people - that you love  
How you might be overwhelmed with hate - all for love  
All the answers lie within your being  
They lie enshrouded in your pain  
Graciously eluding your brain  
Do not doubt you are love itself  
As love is all you are - selfless, hurting and above all beautiful  
All these bad things - seemingly terrible  
Only contribute to the big picture that is terrific  
I hear your heart ache and groan  
I gravitate towards you as I feel your wants pull  
I see through your tone and find need not greed  
I hear softness and a plea  
Do let your hopes lie in me as you lean on me  
Trust that it'll all be beautiful however it be  
I'd like you to dwell on one truth  
That I do love you  
That Love loves Love.
