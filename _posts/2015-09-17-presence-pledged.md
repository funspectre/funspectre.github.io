I'll be there  
When the sky falls, to stand by you  
Stand tall in the face of the pain that crushes you  
And when you're here by my side  
I'll never leave  

I'll be there to wipe your tears  
And help fight your fears  
When you worry about tomorrow  
I'll take those wrinkles away with a smile  
Because every day is a bright one with you  
And every burden a light one too  

When we talk forever, feels like a moment  
And every minute of absence feels like a year of silence  
When we walk, every mile adorns my face with a smile  
And the well of love I've got feels like the Nile  

When I think of everything that be as though it weren't  
Not knowing you would have been ignorance  
And trying not to talk to you would have been impossible resistance  
Lucky would be the wrong word  
Cos I feel blessed to have you as my friend.
