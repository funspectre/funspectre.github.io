Writing is a form of expression for me and it is only inhibited by my thoughts about presentation. I often give too much thought to what to write then my brain goes into a state of overdrive on how to write it. I do think sometimes that my laziness comes to center stage as an affliction in the midst of the mental overwork.

I want to believe that a way to overcome this "laziness" is to get off my gluteus and just do the stuff that I would end up wasting brainpower thinking about if I do not get to it. I have decided to "Just Do It."
