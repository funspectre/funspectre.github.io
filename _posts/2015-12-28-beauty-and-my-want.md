what do I want?  
what do I love?  
there is a feeling I get when I see a face  
a face that radiates beauty  
it runs way beneath the skin  
I know it  
it is not the face  
it is not the glamorous appearance  
it is the flaws behind the seemingly perfect face  
it is all the mannerisms and philosophies  
it is all the things that I endure then come to accept  
it is the assurance that this beauty is going to have my back  
that this beauty will run with me  
help me when my steps falter  
catch me when I fall  
because I am without breath or inhaler  
then appear to knock the air back into my lungs only to take my breath away  
I do not want what I have  
neither do I have what I want  
so I wait  
then chase  
now I wait again
