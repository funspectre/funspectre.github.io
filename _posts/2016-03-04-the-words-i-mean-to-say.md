Hola, Hello!  
maybe that's all I say  
when I mean  
I'd like to know you  
with a plea  
don't hurt me  
with a tale of hurt in my eyes  
don't lie to me  
with a racing heartbeat  
do paint my world  
with colors  
that you would guide my hands to choose  
hello  
do not misconstrue this elation  
i only want simple but deep relations  
i have zero ambition  
i have no hopes to shape your world to my dreams  
let's just join both our worlds at the seams
